# 🚢 Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

A simple Machine Learning project to predict survival on the Titanic using supervised learning algorithms.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This project uses the Titanic dataset from Kaggle to build a predictive model that answers the question: *"What sorts of people were more likely to survive?"*

The main steps include:
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training and Evaluation
- Prediction on Test Data

---

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
